**Contract Team Lead** @ [Vebnet / Standard Life](https://www.standardlife.com/) _(Jan 2010 - July 2012)_ <br>
- Led team that consisted of 3 to 7 people. Conducted daily stand-ups and carded progress of team members. Conducted daily code reviews by having all developers submit diffs of their un-submitted work. Identified stronger developers and assigned them to work in more sensitive areas and allowed them to peer review weaker developersâ€™ code.
- Identified major performance bottlenecks in Hibernate and increased batch processing performance. Identified and repaired many subtle hibernate mapping issues and other critical Hibernate based exceptions.
- Debugged development and runtime class loader issues on multiple development and production containers.
- Used profiling tools on UAT and production servers to find production performance bottlenecks.
- Ported and refactored legacy code from an earlier version of the application. Developed unit tests for legacy code ported into the application.

- Designed and began development of a rule-driven product selection application. Wicket was chosen as the graphical framework after comparing other similar higher level graphical toolkits such as GWT and JSF. Because of the shifting nature of the requirements, iterative development was used. The application is required to be completely dynamic and bring together product, pricing, promotion, and discount data into a clear and extensible application.
- Migrated billing application from IBM's JAX-RPC SOAP stack to Spring-WS using JAX-B, Axiom, and JMS. The application benefited from faster start of iteration binding generation, configuration and debugging.
